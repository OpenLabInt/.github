### Who are we?
OpenLabInt is an open source environment for labour market research. Our goal is threefold; i) speed up development towards automated ontology learning from multilingual labour market data sources; ii) use these ontology learning algorithms to work towards a dynamic standardized labour market ontology with worldwide coverage; and (iii) document, distribute and publish the developed methods and the resulting ontology for use by those interested.
